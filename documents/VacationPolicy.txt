Document: Vacation Policy

Every full-time employee is entitled to 18 paid vacation days per year, accrued monthly.

Vacation can only be used after completing a 3-month probation period.

Unused vacation days roll over to the next calendar year but expire after 18 months if not used.

Employees must submit vacation requests at least 7 business days in advance via the HR Online system. Approval is required from the direct manager.

Extended vacations (over 10 consecutive days) require additional approval from the HR department.
