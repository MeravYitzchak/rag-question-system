Document: Remote Work Guidelines

As of 2024, employees are allowed to work remotely up to two days per week, with manager approval.

When working from home:
- Employees must connect to the company VPN
- Participation in all Zoom meetings is mandatory; availability on Slack is expected during work hours
- Work hours must be logged in the Timely system

Failure to comply may affect continued eligibility for remote work.
